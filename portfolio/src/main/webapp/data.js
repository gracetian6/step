    'I did math research on knots in high school,'
    + 'so my goal was to prove new patterns about '
    + 'these geometrical figures. So, I spent a lot '
    + 'of time drawing a lot of diagrams to test out new ideas.',

    'I went to the Boston Harbor Islands during a '
    + `summer camp. This was one of the worst beaches `
    + `I've been to - the beaches were rocky and it was `
    + `painful walking across it. So many of us got `
    + `sunburns that day and my friend had to run to `
    + `the medical center to get aloe vera gel.`,

    `In a summer camp in my junior year in high school, `
    + `all 80 of us were forced to go out on the lawns `
    + `of MIT on a piece of tarp for 4th of july bonding. `
    + `The sprinklers went off at five in the morning, `
    + `and we were forced to get on the sidewalk. My `
    + `friend and I were annoyed our sleep got disrupted, `
    + `so we continued it on the sidewalk. `,

    `I was quite burned out after my summer camp in ` 
    + `junior year. I was worried about colleges and `
    + `had little motivation. My family went on a walk `
    + `on this nature trial and I felt much more relaxed `
    + `afterwards.`, 

    `I was at the Beijing airport at around 5 or 6 `
    + `AM, and I was waiting for a flight to Hong Kong. `
    + `Then, I got an update from Harvard early admissions `
    + `and got in! I was excited for the rest of the week `
    + `in Hong Kong.`,

    `I didn't have many friends when I did research at `
    + `the University of Minnesota, but I met a really `
    + `good friend I still talk to today. She invited `
    + `me to her family's cabin up north and we picked `
    + `wild blueberries. It was humid, the mosquitoes `
    + `bit me so much that I lost count, but it was a `
    + `fond trip I'll always remember.`,

    `My friend and I were checking statistics homework `
    + `at 2 or 3 AM. I remember we had a good talk. I `
    + `was tired so I stared at the ceiling in `
    + `exasperation and took this pic.`,

    `I went to the Grace Hopper conference in Orlando, `
    + `and I got treated to Universal Studios. It was `
    + `a very magical time witnessing Harry Potter come `
    + `to life, and in that moment I honestly felt so `
    + `lucky to be alive.`,

    `I went up north in Minnesota over the winter and `
    + `we decided to go for a nice winter walk. It got `
    + `really exhausting so I often lied down on the `
    + `snow (highly recommend).`,

    `I used to enjoy drawing when I was little, but `
    + `gave up because coloring was too hard. My `
    + `friend was teaching me how to add color. `
    + `She demonstrated how an orange object reflects `
    + `orange light. `,

    `I have a food gram and was anxious to get a good `
    + `picture while I was at Disney World. We stopped `
    + `by starbucks, and I found the money shot right `
    + `here out in the streets. `,
